# Image_Encryption_Compression

Image_Encryption_Compression is a project developed as part of an algorithms academic course.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing image encryption and compression algorithms using LFSR for encryption and Huffman coding for compression. It provides a platform for experimenting with these techniques to enhance image security and reduce file size.

### Launch Instructions

To successfully launch the project, follow these steps:

1. Open the `.sln` file in your preferred IDE or text editor.

2. Navigate to the `ImageOperations.cs` file and update all string variables with valid paths to ensure the project runs correctly without problems.

3. Press `CTRL + F5` to run the project. This will compile and execute the application.
