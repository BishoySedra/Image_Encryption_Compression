# Image_Encryption_Compression

Image_Encryption_Compression is a project developed as part of an algorithms academic course.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing image encryption and compression algorithms using LFSR for encryption and Huffman coding for compression. It provides a platform for experimenting with these techniques to enhance image security and reduce file size.

For a detailed description of the project, you can refer to the [Project Description Document](https://cisasuedu.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/ALG24.Term2/Shared%20Documents/General/5%20Project/MATERIALS/%5B1%5D%20Image%20Encryption%20and%20Compression/Image%20encryption%20and%20compression.docx?d=wbce7811032d54c4f855900375f7ed4c4&csf=1&web=1&e=HlR29V).

### Launch Instructions

To successfully launch the project, follow these steps:

1. Open the `.sln` file in your preferred IDE or text editor.

2. Navigate to the `ImageOperations.cs` file and update all string variables with valid paths to ensure the project runs correctly without problems.

3. Press `CTRL + F5` to run the project. This will compile and execute the application.
